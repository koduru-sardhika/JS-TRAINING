virtual DOM is a copy of real-DOM
in virtual DOM whenever the element is created it also creates a unique key
when the key is unique the element will be added to real DOM

one to one mapping is done using an algorithm called as diffing algorithm.
react uses a architecture  MVC(MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER)

REACT INSTALL three dependencies:
1.react dependency
    - used to createElement,  stores all-hooks
2.react-DOM
    -used to create virtual-DOM
